### BrunoRV, a.k.a. **[HighGen, the Unbounded](https://steamcommunity.com/id/highgen)**

> I'm an intellectually independent, seasoned developer.

I worked for [LoopKey](https://www.loopkey.com.br) for several years on their access control app and developed Açaí Official's sales and customer apps.

Currently I'm working on my non-techinical skills and *psyching up* for my next endeavour.
